# Educational Platform Management Application
 Educational platform management application developed using C#, WPF, and SQL Server. The application follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern.
 
 ## User Roles

- **Teacher**: Teachers can manage their assigned classes and subjects, including marking attendance, recording grades, uploading teaching materials, and calculating student averages.
- **Homeroom Teacher**: The class teacher plays a vital role in overseeing a specific class. They have the authority to justify absences for students, view individual student absences and grades for any subject, access comprehensive student reports, monitor class rankings based on averages, identify academic distinctions, and address issues related to student academic performance.
- **Student**: Students have access to their class-specific materials, can view their grades, absences, and subject averages. They can monitor their academic progress, evaluate their performance, and identify areas for improvement.
